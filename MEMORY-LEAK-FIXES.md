# Memory Leak Fixes Applied

## Overview
Identified and fixed critical memory leaks in the real-time subscription system to prevent component unmounting issues and resource accumulation.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Subscription Cleanup Enhancement
- **Location**: `services/RealtimeSubscriptionService.ts:408-449`
- **Issue**: Incomplete cleanup of timeouts and listeners
- **Fix**: Enhanced cleanup method with proper promise handling and resource disposal

### 2. Hook Dependency Issues  
- **Location**: `hooks/useRealtimeSubscription.ts:140`
- **Issue**: `errors` dependency causing infinite re-renders
- **Fix**: Removed circular dependency and stabilized effect dependencies

### 3. Component Unmounting Safety
- **Location**: Multiple hooks
- **Issue**: Components attempting to set state after unmounting
- **Fix**: Added `isMounted` guards and proper cleanup patterns

### 4. Timeout Management
- **Location**: `hooks/useRealtimeData.ts:100-114`  
- **Issue**: Timeouts not being cleared on component unmount
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive timeout cleanup in useEffect return functions

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Cleanup Pattern
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  
  const performAsyncWork = async () => {
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    if (isMounted) {
      setState(result);
    }
  };
  
  return () => {
    isMounted = false;
    // Cleanup timeouts, subscriptions, listeners
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Circuit Breaker Integration
- Added proper cleanup for `ConnectionCircuitBreaker` instances
- Ensured all circuit breakers are disposed of during service cleanup
- Prevented resource leaks in connection retry logic

### Performance Monitor Cleanup
- Enhanced `RealtimePerformanceMonitor.cleanup()` to clear all metrics and timers
- Removed event listeners and performance tracking state
- Prevented memory accumulation from performance data

## Validation
- ✅ No more React warnings about setting state on unmounted components
- ✅ Subscription counts properly decrease when components unmount
- ✅ Timeout references are cleared preventing timer accumulation
- ✅ Circuit breakers properly dispose of resources
- ✅ Performance monitoring data is cleared on cleanup

## Prevention Measures
1. **Consistent Pattern**: All hooks now follow the isMounted guard pattern
2. **Timeout Management**: All timeouts are stored in refs and cleared on unmount
3. **Subscription Tracking**: Proper subscription disposal with error handling
4. **Resource Auditing**: Added logging to track subscription lifecycle

## Impact
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced by preventing accumulation of unused subscriptions
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary re-renders and state updates
- **Stability**: Prevented crashes from unmounted component state updates
- **Developer Experience**: Removed console warnings about memory leaks

These fixes ensure the real-time system properly manages resources and prevents memory leaks during normal app usage patterns.
