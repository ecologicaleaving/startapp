## Contingency Planning

### Buffer Time Allocation
- **Week 2**: 1 day buffer for foundation issues
- **Week 4**: 1 day buffer for sync complexity
- **Week 6**: 1 day buffer for service integration
- **Week 8**: 2 days buffer for real-time complexity

### Scope Reduction Options
If timeline pressure occurs:
1. **Week 6**: Defer advanced offline features (keep basic offline)
2. **Week 7**: Reduce live score frequency to 1-minute intervals
3. **Week 8**: Limit real-time features to match scores only (defer tournament status)

### Rollback Procedures
Each week includes rollback capability:
- **Database migrations**: Reversible with down scripts
- **Service changes**: Feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Component modifications**: Backward compatible by design
- **Production deployment**: Blue-green deployment with instant rollback

This timeline provides a structured 8-week implementation path with clear milestones, dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies for successfully delivering the multi-tier caching system enhancement.
