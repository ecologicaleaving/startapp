## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Source: Stories 5.1 and 5.2 Implementation**

Stories 5.1 and 5.2 established the referee interface foundation with key patterns for Story 5.3:

- **State-Based Navigation**: Bottom tab navigation appears after tournament selection, with Results tab ready for implementation
- **Outdoor-Optimized Design**: High-contrast colors, 44px+ touch targets, bold typography proven effective for sunlight visibility
- **Status-Based Color Coding**: Established system (Green: Active/Live, Blue: Scheduled/Upcoming, Gray: Completed, Red: Cancelled)
- **Service Layer Patterns**: RefereeAssignmentsService demonstrates caching, filtering, and auto-refresh patterns to reuse
- **Tournament Context**: Selected tournament from TournamentStorageService provides filtering context
- **Dynamic Refresh**: Intelligent refresh intervals (30s for active content, longer for static) optimize performance

### Data Models and Schema
**Source: [database-schema.md] and [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### Match Scoring Data Structure
The matches table includes comprehensive scoring fields for beach volleyball:

```typescript
interface MatchResult {
  no: string;                    // Match.No - unique identifier
  tournamentNo: string;          // Foreign key to tournaments
  teamAName: string;             // Team names from FIVB API
  teamBName: string;
  status: 'Scheduled' | 'Running' | 'Finished' | 'Cancelled';
  
  // Set-by-set scoring
  matchPointsA: number;          // Overall match points (sets won)
  matchPointsB: number;
  pointsTeamASet1: number;       // Individual set scores
  pointsTeamBSet1: number;
  pointsTeamASet2: number;
  pointsTeamBSet2: number;
  pointsTeamASet3: number;       // Third set (if played)
  pointsTeamBSet3: number;
  
  // Match metadata
  durationSet1: string;          // Set durations for detailed view
  durationSet2: string;
  durationSet3: string;
  localDate: Date;
  localTime: string;
  court: string;
  round: string;
}
```

#### Database Query Patterns
**Source: [database-schema.md]**

```sql
-- Live matches query (for auto-refresh)
SELECT * FROM matches 
WHERE tournament_no = ? AND status = 'Running'
ORDER BY local_date, local_time;

-- Completed matches query
SELECT * FROM matches 
WHERE tournament_no = ? AND status = 'Finished'
ORDER BY local_date DESC, local_time DESC;
```

Performance indexes available: `idx_matches_tournament_no`, `idx_matches_status`, `idx_matches_local_date`

### API Integration
**Source: [api-specifications.md] and [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### Service Layer Enhancement
Builds on existing VisApiService patterns:

- **getBeachMatchList()**: Enhanced method for match results with caching
- **Multi-tier caching**: Memory (30s) → Supabase (live data) → AsyncStorage (offline) → FIVB API (fallback)
- **Dynamic TTL**: 30 seconds for live matches, 15 minutes for completed matches
- **Real-time capability**: WebSocket subscriptions for live score updates (future enhancement)

#### FIVB API Score Data Mapping
**Source: [visDocs/key-data-types.md]**

```typescript
// FIVB API Response → MatchResult transformation
const transformScore = (fivbMatch: BeachMatch): MatchResult => ({
  // Score parsing from XML response
  matchPointsA: parseInt(fivbMatch.MatchPointsA) || 0,
  matchPointsB: parseInt(fivbMatch.MatchPointsB) || 0,
  pointsTeamASet1: parseInt(fivbMatch.PointsTeamASet1) || 0,
  // ... additional score field mappings
  status: normalizeStatus(fivbMatch.Status), // Running/Finished/Scheduled
});
```

### UI/UX Implementation
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/user-flows-referee-specific-features.md]**

#### User Flow 2: View Match Results Requirements

**Entry Points**: Results tab in referee dashboard

**Key UI Requirements**:
- **Live Matches Section**: Prominently displayed with real-time scores
- **Completed Matches Section**: Historical results with final scores
- **Score Display Format**: "21-15, 18-21, 15-12" for beach volleyball scoring
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges using established color system
- **Tap Interaction**: Navigate to detailed match view with full scoring breakdown

#### Component Design Specifications
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/component-library-design-system.md]**

**LiveMatchCard Requirements**:
- **High-contrast green background** (#10B981) for live status
- **Bold team names** with large font sizes (18px+)
- **Current score display** with set-by-set breakdown
- **Pulsing animation** for live indicator (optional enhancement)

**CompletedMatchCard Requirements**:
- **Muted gray styling** (#6B7280) for completed status
- **Final score display** with match duration
- **Smaller visual hierarchy** than live matches
- **Historical context indicators** (date/time completed)

### File Structure and Locations
**Source: Story 5.1 and 5.2 patterns**

```
screens/
  MatchResultsScreen.tsx           // Main results view screen
  MatchDetailScreen.tsx            // Detailed match information view
components/
  referee/
    LiveMatchCard.tsx              // Live match card with real-time scores
    CompletedMatchCard.tsx         // Completed match card with final results
services/
  MatchResultsService.ts           // Match data retrieval and score formatting
types/
  MatchResults.ts                  // TypeScript interfaces for match scoring
```

### Integration with Existing System
**Source: Stories 5.1 and 5.2 implementation patterns**

#### Navigation Integration
- **Results Tab**: Already defined in referee dashboard bottom navigation
- **Tournament Context**: Use TournamentStorageService.getSelectedTournament() for filtering
- **Route Structure**: `/match-results` and `/match-detail` following established patterns

#### Service Layer Integration
- **Follow RefereeAssignmentsService patterns**: Caching, error handling, offline support
- **Reuse CacheService infrastructure**: Multi-tier caching with TTL management
- **Integrate with existing VisApiService**: Enhanced getBeachMatchList() method

### Performance Considerations
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/performance-considerations.md]**

#### Auto-Refresh Strategy
- **Live matches**: 30-second refresh for current scores
- **Completed matches**: Static after loading (no auto-refresh needed)
- **Background sync**: Leverage existing sync jobs from Stories 2.1-2.3
- **Memory optimization**: Cache only current tournament results

#### Offline Capability
- **AsyncStorage fallback**: Store last loaded results for offline viewing
- **Data freshness indicators**: Show timestamp of last successful sync
- **Graceful degradation**: Clear messaging when scores may be stale

### Security and Privacy
**Source: [database-schema.md]**

- **Read-only access**: Match results viewing only, no score editing capability
- **Tournament filtering**: Only show results for referee's selected tournament
- **RLS policies**: Existing Row Level Security handles data access permissions
- **No sensitive data**: Public match scores and tournament results only

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Framework
- **Location**: `screens/__tests__/MatchResultsScreen.test.ts`
- **Framework**: React Native Testing Library with Jest (following Story 5.2 patterns)
- **Coverage**: Score display, auto-refresh, navigation, accessibility

#### Test Scenarios
- **Score formatting**: Various beach volleyball score combinations (2-set, 3-set matches)
- **Live vs Completed**: Different display logic based on match status
- **Auto-refresh**: Timer functionality and API call triggering
- **Empty states**: No matches, loading states, error conditions
- **Touch targets**: 44px minimum requirement validation
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader navigation and semantic labels

### Technical Constraints
**Source: [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

- **React Native**: Version 0.79.5 with new architecture
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout implementation  
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing for navigation
- **AsyncStorage**: For offline data persistence
- **No external libraries**: Use established React Native and project patterns
