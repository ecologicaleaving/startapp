```

### Network State Management Requirements
**React Native NetInfo Integration** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#mobile_optimization]:
```typescript
// Network connectivity detection and monitoring
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';

interface NetworkState {
  isConnected: boolean;
  type: 'wifi' | 'cellular' | 'ethernet' | 'unknown';
  isInternetReachable: boolean;
  details: {
    strength?: number;
    cellularGeneration?: '2g' | '3g' | '4g' | '5g';
    carrier?: string;
  };
}
```

**Adaptive Connection Strategies** [Source: Story 4.2 Performance Architecture]:
- **Wi-Fi Networks**: Aggressive WebSocket connections with faster reconnection
- **Cellular Networks**: Conservative connection management with longer timeouts
- **Weak Signal**: Automatic fallback to polling with extended intervals
- **Intermittent Connection**: Hybrid mode with both WebSocket and polling backups

### Enhanced Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Advanced ConnectionCircuitBreaker Extension** [Source: services/ConnectionCircuitBreaker.ts analysis]:
```typescript
// Extend existing circuit breaker with network awareness
class NetworkAwareCircuitBreaker extends ConnectionCircuitBreaker {
  // Add network-specific failure thresholds
  // Implement adaptive timeout based on connection quality  
  // Create network-specific recovery strategies
  // Add connection quality assessment
}
```

**Connection Quality Metrics**:

  suspendConnections(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Quick resume with priority restoration
  resumeConnections(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Background sync for critical updates
  scheduleBackgroundSync(): void;
  
  // Extended background cleanup
  cleanupIdleConnections(): void;
}
```

**React Native App State Handling**:
- **Background Mode**: Aggressive connection suspension after 30 seconds
- **Foreground Resume**: Priority connection restoration within 2 seconds
- **Inactive State**: Partial suspension with critical subscriptions maintained
- **Background Refresh**: Scheduled sync for tournament status and live scores

### Advanced Resource Management
**Memory and Battery Optimization** [Source: Story 4.2 RealtimePerformanceMonitor]:
```typescript

  // Memory pressure handling  
  handleMemoryPressure(): void;
  
  // Battery usage optimization
  optimizeBatteryUsage(): void;
  
  // Connection pooling efficiency
  optimizeConnectionPooling(): void;
}
```

**Resource Optimization Strategies**:
- **Low Battery Mode**: Reduced connection frequency and automatic polling fallback
- **Memory Pressure**: Connection cleanup and subscription consolidation
- **Thermal Throttling**: Automatic performance reduction for device cooling
- **Background App Refresh**: Intelligent background activity management

### Fallback System Enhancement
**Intelligent Mode Switching** [Source: services/RealtimeFallbackService.ts]:
```typescript

  // Connection reliability prediction
  predictConnectionReliability(): number;
  
  // Hybrid mode for different data types
  enableHybridMode(): void;
  
  // Smart polling frequency adjustment
  adjustPollingFrequency(networkConditions: NetworkState): void;
  
  // User preference integration
  applyUserFallbackPreferences(): void;
}
```

**Fallback Mode Types**:
- **Pure WebSocket**: Optimal conditions with stable, fast connections
- **Hybrid Mode**: WebSocket for critical data, polling for non-critical updates
- **Smart Polling**: Adaptive polling frequencies based on data importance and network state
- **Offline Mode**: Local cache with manual refresh capabilities

### Connection Diagnostics and Recovery
**Advanced Manual Controls** [Source: components/ UI integration]:
```typescript
// Enhanced manual refresh with diagnostics
interface ConnectionDiagnostics {
  // Connection health assessment
  assessConnectionHealth(): ConnectionHealth;
  
  // Reset connection state
  resetConnection(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Force connection mode
  forceConnectionMode(mode: 'websocket' | 'polling' | 'hybrid'): void;
  
  // Clear connection-related cache
  clearConnectionCache(): void;
}
```

**User-Facing Controls**:
- **Connection Status Display**: Real-time connection quality and mode indicators
- **Manual Refresh Options**: Full sync, selective refresh, cache clearing
- **Connection Mode Toggle**: User preference for connection strategy
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Contextual help for connection issues

### Database and Caching Integration
**Real-Time Database Optimization** [Source: database-schema.md from Story 4.1-4.3]:
```sql
-- Connection state tracking table
CREATE TABLE connection_states (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_session_id VARCHAR,
  connection_type VARCHAR,        -- 'websocket', 'polling', 'hybrid', 'offline'  
  network_type VARCHAR,          -- 'wifi', 'cellular', 'ethernet', 'unknown'

  last_successful_ping TIMESTAMP,
  failure_count INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Cache Strategy Enhancement**:
- **Connection-Aware Caching**: Different TTL strategies based on connection reliability
