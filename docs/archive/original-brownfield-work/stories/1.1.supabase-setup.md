### Security Review

**Status: SECURE** ðŸ”’

- Environment variables properly isolated in .env.local (not committed to git)
- Service role key separate from anonymous key with appropriate usage
- RLS policies follow principle of least privilege (public read, service full access)
- PKCE authentication flow enabled for enhanced security
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials in codebase
- Migration functions use SECURITY DEFINER appropriately

### Performance Considerations

**Status: OPTIMIZED** âš¡

- React Native specific optimizations applied:
  - Realtime events throttled to 10/second for mobile performance
  - Session persistence enabled with AsyncStorage
  - detectSessionInUrl disabled for React Native environment
- Connection testing uses minimal queries for efficiency
- Error handling prevents unnecessary retries

### Final Status

**âœ… Approved - Ready for Done**

This implementation exceeds expectations for a foundational setup story. The code demonstrates senior-level architectural thinking with:

- **Production-ready configuration** with proper security policies
- **Maintainable architecture** with clean separation of concerns  
- **Comprehensive testing strategy** covering both integration and unit levels
- **Developer experience focus** with clear setup instructions and automation
- **Future-proof design** with migration-based approach for schema evolution

The refactoring I performed enhances the already solid foundation with better type safety, performance optimizations, and test coverage. This story provides an excellent base for subsequent database and caching implementation stories.

**Recommended for immediate promotion to Done status.**
