# Story 5.1: Referee Tournament Selection Interface

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** tournament referee,  
**I want** a clean tournament selection interface that shows current tournaments and remembers my selection,  
**so that** I can quickly access my assigned tournament when using the app in outdoor conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/information-architecture.md]**

#### State-Based Navigation Pattern
The referee interface uses progressive disclosure - new users see only tournament selection, returning users go directly to referee dashboard.

**Navigation States**:
- **State 1 (No Tournament Selected)**: Full-screen tournament selection, no bottom navigation
- **State 2 (Tournament Selected)**: Bottom tab navigation with referee-specific tabs

**Persistent State Management**:
- Use AsyncStorage to save selected tournament
- Auto-resume to referee dashboard on app reopen
- Tournament switching always available

#### Tournament Selection Flow
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/user-flows-referee-specific-features.md]**

**Flow Sequence**:
1. App Launch → Check user state
2. New User → Tournament Selection Screen
3. Tap Tournament Card → Tournament Detail/Confirmation Screen  
4. "Switch to this Tournament" → Save selection + Navigate to Dashboard
5. Returning User → Auto-navigate to Dashboard

### UI/UX Specifications
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/ux-goals-principles.md]**

#### Design Principles for Implementation
1. **Visibility First** - Maximum contrast and large fonts
2. **Essential Information Only** - Clean, focused tournament selection
3. **Touch-Optimized** - 44px minimum touch targets
4. **Status-Driven Design** - Clear visual indicators
5. **Consistent Navigation** - Same patterns throughout

#### Target User Context
**Primary Persona**: Tournament referee using app in bright sunlight conditions
- Technical comfort: Moderate
- Physical context: Standing/moving outdoors, potentially wearing gloves
- Speed requirement: Identify tournament within 3 seconds

### Visual Design Requirements  
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/branding-style-guide.md]**

#### Color Palette (High Contrast)
- **Primary**: #1B365D (Navigation, headers)
- **Secondary**: #4A90A4 (Supporting elements)
- **Accent**: #FF6B35 (Call-to-action buttons)
- **Success**: #2E8B57 (Active/live indicators)
- **Surface**: #FFFFFF (Card backgrounds)

#### Typography Requirements
- **Hero Text**: 40px Bold (Current tournament selection)
- **H1**: 32px Bold (Screen titles)
- **H2**: 24px Semibold (Tournament names)
- **Body Large**: 18px Regular (Tournament details)
- **Minimum Size**: 12px (no text smaller than this)

### Existing System Integration
**Source: [CLAUDE.md] and [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### React Native Expo Setup
- **Platform**: Expo Router with file-based routing

- `app/index.tsx` - State-based initial screen routing

### Performance Requirements
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/performance-considerations.md]**

#### Performance Goals
- **Page Load**: Under 2 seconds on 3G
- **Interaction Response**: Under 100ms for all taps
- **Tournament Selection**: Visible within 3 seconds of app launch

#### Optimization Strategies
- AsyncStorage caching for selected tournament
- Reuse existing TournamentList component for consistency
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size for core tournament selection

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing Framework
- **Location**: `screens/__tests__/TournamentSelectionScreen.test.ts`
- **Framework**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Coverage**: State management, navigation, AsyncStorage integration

#### Test Scenarios Required
- New user tournament selection flow
- Returning user auto-navigation
- Tournament switching functionality
- AsyncStorage persistence and retrieval
- Navigation state transitions
- Touch interaction responsiveness
- High-contrast styling validation

### Integration Notes
**Source: Current codebase analysis**

This story establishes the foundation for the referee interface by creating the tournament selection and state management system. It integrates with the existing tournament data structure and VisApiService while adding referee-specific navigation patterns.

The implementation should preserve all existing functionality while adding the new referee-focused interface as an alternative entry point to the tournament data.
