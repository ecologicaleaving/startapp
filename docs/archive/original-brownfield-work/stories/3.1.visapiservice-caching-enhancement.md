## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Comprehensive monitoring system implemented for sync operations
- Error logging and classification system available in ErrorLogger.ts
- Performance metrics collection established in MetricsCollector.ts
- Multi-tier caching architecture foundation already in place
- Testing patterns established with 90%+ coverage standards

### Architecture Context
[Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml]

#### Existing System Analysis
**Current VisApiService Implementation:**
- Location: `/services/visApi.ts`
- Base URL: `https://www.fivb.org/Vis2009/XmlRequest.asmx`
- Authentication: `X-FIVB-App-ID` header with value `2a9523517c52420da73d927c6d6bab23`
- Data format: XML responses parsed to TypeScript interfaces

**Current Tournament Data Flow:**
- Direct API calls via `getTournamentListWithDetails()` method
- XML request: `GetBeachTournamentList` with fields `No Code Name StartDate EndDate`
- Filtering: Status='Running', date range +/-1 month from today
- Response parsing: XML to Tournament[] array with No, Code, Name, StartDate, EndDate, Version fields

**Tournament Classification Logic:**
```typescript
// Current classification algorithm in VisApiService.classifyTournament()
// FIVB: name contains 'fivb', 'world tour', 'world championship'  
// BPT: name/code contains 'bpt', 'beach pro tour', 'challenge', 'elite16'
// CEV: name/code contains 'cev', 'european', 'europa', 'championship'
// LOCAL: default fallback for other tournaments
```

#### Multi-Tier Cache Architecture
[Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml, CacheService.ts]

**Existing Cache Infrastructure:**
- **Tier 1 Memory**: MemoryCacheManager with 50MB max size, 1000 max entries
- **Tier 2 Local Storage**: LocalStorageManager with 7-day max age
- **Tier 3 Supabase**: PostgreSQL cache via supabase client
- **Tier 4 API**: Direct FIVB API fallback (existing behavior)

**Cache Configuration:**
```typescript
// Current CacheService configuration
defaultTTL: {
  tournaments: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  matchesScheduled: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes  
  matchesLive: 30 * 1000, // 30 seconds
  matchesFinished: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hours
}
```

**Cache Key Generation:**
- Format: `tournaments_${JSON.stringify(filters || {})}`
- Includes filter options for proper cache segmentation
- Memory and localStorage use same key format

#### Service Integration Pattern
[Source: technical-implementation-details.md]

**Enhanced Method Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Target implementation for getTournamentListWithDetails()
static async getTournamentListWithDetails(filterOptions?: FilterOptions): Promise<Tournament[]> {
  try {
    // Tier 1-3: Use CacheService with 4-tier fallback
    const cacheResult = await CacheService.getTournaments(filterOptions);
    if (cacheResult && cacheResult.data) {
      return cacheResult.data;
    }

    // Tier 4: Existing direct API implementation (preserved exactly)
    return await this.fetchDirectFromAPI(filterOptions);
  } catch (error) {
    // Maintain existing error handling behavior
    console.error('Error fetching tournaments:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch active tournaments');
  }
}
```

#### Database Integration
[Source: Stories 2.1, 2.2 - existing sync infrastructure]

**Supabase Tables Available:**
- `tournaments` table: id, no, code, name, start_date, end_date, status, last_synced, version
- `sync_status` table: entity_type, last_sync, sync_frequency, next_sync, success_count, error_count
- Daily sync via `tournament-master-sync` Edge Function updates tournament cache

**Real-time Capability:**
- Supabase real-time subscriptions available for tournaments table
- Background sync jobs maintain cache freshness
- Sync monitoring and alerting already implemented

### Component Integration Requirements
[Source: component-integration-guide.md]

#### TournamentList Component Compatibility
**Current Implementation (NO CHANGES REQUIRED):**
```typescript
// Existing pattern in /components/TournamentList.tsx
const fetchTournaments = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const data = await VisApiService.getTournamentListWithDetails(filterOptions);
    setTournaments(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching tournaments:', error);
    setError('Failed to load tournaments');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

**Post-Enhancement Behavior (TRANSPARENT):**
- Same API call: `VisApiService.getTournamentListWithDetails()`
- Same response format: `Tournament[]` array
- Same error handling: Errors propagate identically
- NEW: 70% faster loading via cache hits
- NEW: Offline capability for previously loaded data

#### Filter Options Preservation
**Existing Filter Interface:**
```typescript
interface FilterOptions {
  recentOnly?: boolean;
  year?: number;
  currentlyActive?: boolean;
  tournamentType?: TournamentType; // 'ALL' | 'FIVB' | 'CEV' | 'BPT' | 'LOCAL'
}
```

**Cache Integration Requirements:**
- Cache keys must include filter parameters for proper segmentation
- Tournament classification must work on cached data
- Date filtering (recentOnly, year) must work with cache
- currentlyActive filtering must respect cache TTL

### Performance Requirements
