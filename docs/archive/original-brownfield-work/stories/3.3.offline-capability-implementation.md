### Architecture Context
[Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml]

#### Current Multi-Tier Cache Infrastructure
**Existing Cache Tiers** (Ready for offline enhancement):
- **Tier 1 Memory**: MemoryCacheManager with tournament-specific cache keys
- **Tier 2 Local Storage**: LocalStorageManager with AsyncStorage - **EXTEND FOR OFFLINE**
- **Tier 3 Supabase**: PostgreSQL cache with real-time sync capabilities
- **Tier 4 API**: Direct FIVB API fallback

#### Offline Storage Strategy
**AsyncStorage Integration** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#offline_support]:
```typescript
// Enhanced Local Storage for Offline Capability
storage_tiers:
  tier_2_local: "AsyncStorage for offline persistence"
  
offline_support:
  local_cache: "AsyncStorage with last successful data fetch"
  user_notification: "Clear indication of offline mode and data freshness"
  auto_recovery: "Automatic sync when network connectivity restored"
```

#### Network Connectivity Detection
**React Native Network APIs** [Source: package.json dependencies]:
- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**: Already available (v2.2.0)
- **React Native NetInfo**: For network connectivity detection (to be added)
- **Expo Constants**: Available for app state detection

#### Data Storage Management
**Storage Optimization** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#storage_considerations]:
```typescript
// Storage Management Configuration
defaultTTL: {
  tournaments: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  matchesScheduled: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes  
  matchesLive: 30 * 1000, // 30 seconds
  matchesFinished: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hours
}
```

### File Locations and Project Structure
[Source: Previous story implementations]

**Service Files** (Enhancement required):
- `/services/LocalStorageManager.ts` - **ENHANCE**: Add offline-specific storage methods
- `/services/CacheService.ts` - **ENHANCE**: Add network-aware cache fallback logic  
- `/services/NetworkMonitor.ts` - **NEW**: Network connectivity monitoring service
- `/services/OfflineStorageService.ts` - **NEW**: Offline-specific storage management

**Component Files** (New UI components needed):
- `/components/NetworkStatus.tsx` - **NEW**: Online/offline indicator component
- `/components/DataFreshness.tsx` - **NEW**: Data timestamp and freshness indicator
- `/components/OfflineBanner.tsx` - **NEW**: Offline mode notification banner

**Hook Files** (New React hooks):
- `/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts` - **NEW**: Network connectivity hook
- `/hooks/useOfflineStorage.ts` - **NEW**: Offline data access hook

### Network Connectivity Integration
[Source: React Native documentation, brownfield-architecture.yaml]

**Network Monitoring Implementation**:
```typescript
// Network Status Detection Pattern
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';

const useNetworkStatus = () => {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
      setIsConnected(state.isConnected);
    });
    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);
  
  return { isConnected };
};
```

### Offline-First Cache Strategy
[Source: CacheService.ts, brownfield-architecture.yaml#cache_strategy]

**Enhanced Cache Fallback for Offline Mode**:
```typescript
// Offline-Aware Cache Retrieval Pattern
static async getOfflineTournaments(): Promise<Tournament[]> {
  // Priority 1: Memory cache (if available)
  // Priority 2: Local Storage (persistent offline cache)
  // Priority 3: Only attempt Supabase/API if network available
  // Priority 4: Return empty with offline indicator if no cached data
}
```

### UI Integration Requirements
[Source: Component compatibility patterns from Story 3.1 & 3.2]

#### Existing Component Preservation
**No Changes Required** to existing components:
- `TournamentList.tsx` - Tournament display remains unchanged
- `TournamentDetail.tsx` - Match data display works identically  
- All existing navigation and filtering functionality preserved

#### New UI Components Integration
**Offline UI Enhancements**:
- **Network Status Indicator**: Small banner or icon showing connection state
- **Data Freshness Display**: Timestamps showing when data was last updated
- **Offline Mode Banner**: Prominent but non-intrusive offline notification
- **Storage Management UI**: Optional user controls for cache management

### Storage Quota Management
[Source: AsyncStorage best practices, brownfield-architecture.yaml]

**Storage Size Constraints**:
- **AsyncStorage Limit**: ~6MB on iOS, ~6MB on Android (practical limits)
- **Tournament Data Size**: ~1KB per tournament, ~5KB per match list
- **Target Storage Usage**: <2MB total to leave headroom
- **LRU Eviction**: Remove least recently used tournaments when approaching limits

**Data Compression Strategy**:
```typescript
// Storage Optimization Pattern
const compressedData = JSON.stringify({
  tournaments: tournaments.map(optimizeForStorage),
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  version: 1
});
```

### Performance Considerations
[Source: Story 3.2 performance patterns]

**Offline Performance Targets**:
- **Local Storage Access**: <50ms for tournament list retrieval
- **Network Detection**: <100ms for connectivity status updates
- **Cache Eviction**: <200ms for storage cleanup operations
- **UI Responsiveness**: Offline indicators appear within 500ms of network change

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Story 3.1 & 3.2 testing patterns]

**Offline Testing Categories**:
1. **Network State Testing**: Simulate offline/online transitions
2. **Storage Quota Testing**: Test behavior near AsyncStorage limits  
3. **Data Freshness Testing**: Verify timestamp accuracy and display
4. **Partial Data Testing**: Test graceful handling of missing offline data
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate offline response times meet targets

**Test File Locations**:
- `/services/__tests__/OfflineStorageService.test.ts` - Offline storage functionality
- `/services/__tests__/NetworkMonitor.test.ts` - Network connectivity monitoring
- `/hooks/__tests__/useNetworkStatus.test.ts` - Network status hook testing
- `/components/__tests__/OfflineUI.integration.test.ts` - Offline UI component testing

### Technical Constraints
[Source: React Native AsyncStorage limitations]

**AsyncStorage Constraints**:
- **Size Limits**: 6MB practical limit on both iOS and Android
- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**: All AsyncStorage operations are asynchronous
- **Error Handling**: Storage can fail due to disk space or permissions
- **Data Serialization**: Only string storage - all data must be JSON serialized

**Network Detection Constraints**:
- **React Native Limitation**: Network state detection requires additional library
- **iOS/Android Differences**: Network state APIs differ between platforms
- **Background Behavior**: Network monitoring in background apps has limitations

### Data Consistency and Sync Strategy
[Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#data_synchronization]

**Offline Sync Strategy**:
```typescript
// Sync Resume Pattern
const resumeSyncWhenOnline = async () => {
  if (networkStatus.isConnected) {
    // Validate cached data freshness
    // Sync expired data from Supabase/API
    // Update UI with fresh data indicators
  }
};
```

**Conflict Resolution**:
- **Simple Strategy**: Server data always wins during sync resume
- **No User Modifications**: Read-only offline data eliminates conflicts
- **Timestamp Validation**: Use server timestamps to determine freshness

## Testing

### Test File Locations
Following Story 3.1 & 3.2 established patterns:
- `/services/__tests__/OfflineStorageService.test.ts` - Offline storage management tests
- `/services/__tests__/NetworkMonitor.test.ts` - Network connectivity monitoring tests
- `/services/__tests__/CacheService.offline.test.ts` - Enhanced cache service offline behavior  
- `/hooks/__tests__/useNetworkStatus.test.ts` - Network status hook tests
- `/hooks/__tests__/useOfflineStorage.test.ts` - Offline storage hook tests
- `/components/__tests__/OfflineUI.integration.test.ts` - Offline UI component integration tests

### Testing Framework and Standards
**Frameworks:** Jest for unit testing, React Native Testing Library for component tests
**Coverage Target:** 90%+ following Story 3.1 & 3.2 standards
**Mock Requirements:** Mock AsyncStorage, NetInfo, network conditions, storage quota scenarios

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
1. **Offline State Testing**: Simulate network connectivity changes
2. **Storage Quota Testing**: Test behavior when approaching AsyncStorage limits
3. **Data Persistence Testing**: Verify data survives app restarts in offline mode
4. **UI State Testing**: Validate offline indicators display correctly
5. **Sync Resume Testing**: Test automatic sync when network returns
6. **Partial Data Testing**: Handle scenarios with missing offline data
7. **Performance Testing**: Validate offline response times meet targets
