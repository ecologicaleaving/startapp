# Epic 3: Service Layer Integration
**Duration**: Weeks 5-6  
**Business Value**: Seamless integration provides immediate performance benefits to existing components  
**Risk Level**: Low (backward compatible service enhancement)

## Epic Description
As a **tournament app user**, I want the app to load tournament and match data instantly from the cache while maintaining all existing functionality, so that I have a faster, more responsive experience when browsing tournaments and matches.

## User Stories

### Story 3.1: VisApiService Caching Enhancement
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** tournament lists to load instantly when I open the app  
**So that** I can quickly browse available tournaments without waiting  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `getTournamentListWithDetails()` enhanced with 4-tier cache fallback
