# Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure
**Duration**: Weeks 1-2  
**Business Value**: Establishes robust caching infrastructure without disrupting existing functionality  
**Risk Level**: Low (additive infrastructure only)

## Epic Description
As a **system administrator**, I want to establish a robust multi-tier caching infrastructure so that the application can intelligently cache tournament data while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing functionality.

## User Stories

### Story 1.1: Supabase Project Setup
**As a** development team  
**I want** to set up a production-ready Supabase project  
**So that** I have a reliable PostgreSQL backend for caching tournament data  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Supabase project created with production-grade configuration
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- [ ] Service role and anonymous keys configured
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions enabled for tournaments and matches tables
- [ ] Environment variables configured for development and production
- [ ] Database connection successful from React Native app

**Definition of Done**:
- Supabase dashboard accessible and configured
- All security policies tested and working
- Connection established from development environment

### Story 1.2: Database Schema Implementation
**As a** backend developer  
**I want** to create optimized database tables for tournament and match caching  
**So that** data can be stored efficiently with fast query performance  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `tournaments` table created with all required fields mapped from FIVB API
- [ ] `matches` table created with foreign key relationship to tournaments
- [ ] `sync_status` table created for monitoring synchronization health
- [ ] All performance indexes created (tournament code, dates, status)
- [ ] RLS policies configured for read/write access patterns
- [ ] Data retention and cleanup functions implemented

**Definition of Done**:
- Schema matches specification in database-schema.md
- All indexes created and query performance validated
- RLS policies tested with different user roles

### Story 1.3: CacheService Core Implementation
**As a** mobile app developer  
**I want** a robust CacheService class that handles multi-tier fallback logic  
**So that** the app can intelligently retrieve data from the fastest available source  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] CacheService class implements all 4 cache tiers (Memory, Local, Supabase, API)
- [ ] Intelligent fallback logic handles failures at each tier
- [ ] TTL (Time To Live) validation for each cache level
- [ ] Memory cache with configurable size limits
- [ ] AsyncStorage integration for offline persistence
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- [ ] Cache statistics tracking for performance monitoring

**Definition of Done**:
- Unit tests pass for all cache tier scenarios
- Fallback logic tested with simulated failures
- Performance benchmarks established for cache operations

---

## Epic Success Criteria
- [ ] Supabase infrastructure operational and secure
- [ ] Database schema supports all required FIVB API data
- [ ] CacheService successfully implements 4-tier architecture
- [ ] Zero impact on existing application functionality
- [ ] Foundation ready for background synchronization implementation
