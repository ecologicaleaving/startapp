# Epic 2: Background Synchronization
**Duration**: Weeks 3-4  
**Business Value**: Automated data synchronization reduces API dependency and ensures fresh cached data  
**Risk Level**: Medium (external API dependency and timing considerations)

## Epic Description
As a **tournament app user**, I want the app to automatically synchronize tournament and match data in the background so that I always have access to current information without experiencing slow API calls during my usage.

## User Stories

### Story 2.1: Tournament Master Data Sync
**As a** tournament app user  
**I want** tournament information to be automatically updated daily  
**So that** I can browse current tournaments without waiting for slow API calls  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Supabase Edge Function created for daily tournament synchronization
- [ ] Function scheduled to run at 00:00 UTC daily via cron trigger
- [ ] Handles FIVB API authentication with stored credentials
- [ ] Upserts tournament data with conflict resolution on tournament number
- [ ] Updates `sync_status` table with success/failure information
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- [ ] Performance optimized for batch tournament processing

**Definition of Done**:
- Edge function deployed and scheduled successfully
- Tournament data synchronizes correctly from FIVB API
- Error scenarios tested and handled appropriately
- Sync status tracked accurately in database

### Story 2.2: Match Schedule Synchronization
**As a** tournament follower  
**I want** match schedules to be updated every 15 minutes  
**So that** I have current information about match times and court assignments  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Edge Function for match schedule sync every 15 minutes (:00, :15, :30, :45)
- [ ] Fetches match data for all currently running tournaments
- [ ] Handles match rescheduling and court assignment changes
- [ ] Optimized batch processing to minimize API calls
- [ ] Error handling for individual tournament failures doesn't stop overall sync
- [ ] Sync metrics tracked for monitoring purposes
- [ ] Graceful handling of tournament completion

**Definition of Done**:
- Match sync runs reliably every 15 minutes
- All active tournaments synchronized successfully
- Performance metrics show efficient API usage
- Error recovery tested and working

### Story 2.3: Sync Monitoring and Health Tracking
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of synchronization job health  
**So that** I can quickly identify and resolve data sync issues  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `sync_status` table tracks all sync job executions
- [ ] Success/failure rates monitored with historical tracking
- [ ] Error details logged with timestamps for troubleshooting
- [ ] Sync job performance metrics collected (duration, records processed)
- [ ] Alerting system for consecutive sync failures
- [ ] Dashboard view of sync health status
- [ ] Manual sync trigger capability for emergency updates

**Definition of Done**:
- All sync jobs monitored and status tracked
- Error alerting system operational
- Manual intervention capabilities tested
- Performance baselines established
