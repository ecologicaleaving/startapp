# Archive - Original Brownfield Work

This archive contains the original brownfield development work that was completed before the UX audit and epic reorganization.

## Contents

### `original-brownfield-work/`
Contains all the original development documentation and stories from the initial brownfield implementation phase:

- **`brownfield-prd.md` & `brownfield-prd/`** - Original product requirements document and detailed specifications
- **`epic-user-stories/` & `detailed-development-stories.md`** - Original epic structure and user stories for technical implementation
- **`stories/`** - Detailed development stories (1.1-4.4) covering:
  - Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Supabase setup, database schema, cache service)
  - Epic 2: Background Synchronization (tournament data sync, monitoring)
  - Epic 3: Service Layer Integration (caching enhancements, offline capability)
  - Epic 4: Real-time Features (live score sync, WebSocket subscriptions)
- **`implementation-timeline.md`** - Original project timeline
- **`brownfield-architecture.yaml`** - Technical architecture specification

## Archive Purpose

This work was archived on **2025-08-12** during the epic reorganization to make way for the new **UX-focused epic structure** based on the comprehensive UX audit findings.

### Key Transition

**From:** Technical brownfield implementation epics focused on backend integration and data management  
**To:** UX transformation epics focused on referee experience optimization and outdoor usability

## Historical Context

The archived work represents a complete technical foundation implementation that successfully:

- ✅ **Resolved circular dependencies** between CacheService and VisApiService  
- ✅ **Implemented comprehensive caching system** with intelligent data management
- ✅ **Built real-time synchronization** with WebSocket subscriptions
- ✅ **Created offline capability** for critical referee functions
- ✅ **Established performance monitoring** and health tracking
- ✅ **Fixed memory leaks** and stabilized test infrastructure
- ✅ **Achieved 76% reduction** in ESLint warnings (38 → 9)

## Current Active Work

See the main `/docs/epics/` directory for the current **UX transformation epics**:

1. **Epic 001:** Outdoor-Optimized Visual Design System
2. **Epic 002:** Professional Referee Component Library  
3. **Epic 003:** Referee-Centric Screen Architecture
4. **Epic 004:** Accessibility & Compliance Excellence
5. **Epic 005:** Performance & Offline Optimization
6. **Epic 006:** Advanced Interaction & Navigation

The archived technical work provides the solid foundation upon which these UX epics will build to transform the application from a generic tournament viewer (4.5/10 UX score) into a professional referee tool (8.2/10 target).
