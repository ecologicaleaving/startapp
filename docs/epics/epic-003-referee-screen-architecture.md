## Epic Overview

### Problem Statement
The current referee tournament dashboard uses generic screen layouts that fail to prioritize referee-specific workflows and information hierarchy. The UX audit revealed a critical **Screen Layout Score of 5/10**, highlighting poor information architecture that doesn't align with referee operational patterns. Key issues include:

- **No Current Assignment Prominence** - Current assignments buried in generic lists without visual priority
- **Missing "My Assignments" Functionality** - No dedicated screen for referee-centric assignment management
- **Poor Information Hierarchy** - Generic tournament viewer layout doesn't prioritize referee-relevant information
- **Inefficient Assignment Recognition** - Referees spend >10 seconds identifying current assignments
- **Scattered Assignment Status** - Assignment states not visually prominent across screens
- **Generic Dashboard Layout** - No referee-specific dashboard optimized for their workflow patterns

### Business Impact
Tournament referees require screen architectures designed around their operational workflows, not generic tournament viewing. Poor screen design directly impacts:
- **Assignment Recognition Speed** - Time lost locating current and upcoming assignments
- **Workflow Efficiency** - Multiple navigation steps required for core referee tasks
- **Operational Accuracy** - Poor information hierarchy leads to assignment confusion
- **Professional Tool Credibility** - Generic layouts undermine referee workflow optimization
- **Time Management** - Inefficient screen design impacts referee schedule adherence

### Solution Overview
Transform screen architecture from generic tournament viewing into **referee-workflow-optimized screen design** with:
- **Assignment-First Dashboard** - Current assignment prominently displayed with countdown and context
- **Dedicated My Assignments Screen** - Comprehensive referee assignment management with timeline view
- **Referee Information Hierarchy** - Information architecture prioritizing referee-relevant data
- **Assignment Status Prominence** - Visual assignment state indicators across all screens
- **Context-Aware Navigation** - Navigation optimized for referee task completion patterns
- **Workflow-Driven Screen Flows** - Screen transitions designed around referee operational sequences

## Conclusion

Epic 003: Referee-Centric Screen Architecture represents the transformation of the referee tournament dashboard from generic tournament viewing into a workflow-optimized professional referee tool. This epic restructures the entire user interface around referee operational patterns, ensuring that every screen interaction supports efficient referee task completion.

The comprehensive screen redesign approach prioritizes referee workflow needs while maintaining usability for occasional users. The assignment-first dashboard, dedicated My Assignments screen, and referee information hierarchy create a cohesive screen architecture that reduces cognitive load and improves operational efficiency for tournament referees working under time pressure.

**Key Success Factor:** Screen architecture validation must include actual referee workflow testing in tournament conditions to ensure that the redesigned interfaces genuinely improve task completion speed and reduce referee cognitive load. The 8/10 target score must represent measurable improvement in referee operational efficiency, not just aesthetic interface improvements. The <3 second assignment recognition target serves as a concrete measure of the architecture's effectiveness in supporting referee workflow priorities.
