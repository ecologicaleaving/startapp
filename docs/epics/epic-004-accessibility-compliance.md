## Epic Overview

### Problem Statement
The current referee tournament dashboard has a critical **Accessibility Score of 4/10**, making it inaccessible to referees with visual or motor impairments and non-compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards. The UX audit revealed significant accessibility gaps that create barriers for inclusive referee participation and pose legal compliance risks. Key issues include:

- **Insufficient contrast ratios** that fail to meet WCAG AAA requirements for outdoor conditions
- **Incomplete screen reader support** preventing access for visually impaired referees
- **Missing keyboard navigation** blocking access for referees with motor impairments
- **Poor semantic structure** that confuses assistive technologies
- **Inadequate focus management** creating navigation difficulties
- **Missing accessibility labels** on critical interactive elements

### Business Impact
Accessibility compliance is not just a legal requirement—it's essential for inclusive referee participation in volleyball tournaments. Poor accessibility directly impacts:

- **Legal compliance risk** - WCAG 2.1 AA standards are legally mandated in many jurisdictions
- **Referee pool limitations** - Excluding referees with disabilities reduces available tournament staff
- **Professional inclusivity** - Sports organizations are committed to inclusive participation
- **Challenging conditions support** - Enhanced accessibility benefits all referees in difficult conditions
- **Brand reputation** - Accessibility demonstrates commitment to professional standards

### Solution Overview
Transform the application into a fully accessible, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant referee tool with AAA color contrast standards, featuring:
- **7:1 contrast ratios** exceeding AAA standards for maximum outdoor visibility
- **Comprehensive screen reader support** with optimized VoiceOver/TalkBack integration
- **Full keyboard navigation** enabling complete functionality without touch interaction
- **Semantic HTML structure** with proper heading hierarchy for logical information flow
- **Enhanced focus management** with high-visibility focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Automated accessibility testing** integrated into development workflow
