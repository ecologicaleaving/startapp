## Technical Requirements

### Performance Architecture

#### Offline-First Design
```typescript
interface OfflineStrategy {
  cacheStrategy: 'critical-first' | 'assignment-priority' | 'tournament-context';
  syncStrategy: 'immediate' | 'background' | 'scheduled';
  dataFreshness: {
    assignments: '1-hour';
    tournaments: '4-hours';
    results: 'real-time';
  };
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  screenLoadTimes: {
    [screenName: string]: {
      target: number;
      current: number;
      p95: number;
    };
  };
  cachePerformance: {
    hitRate: number;
    missRate: number;
    storageEfficiency: number;
  };
  offlineCapability: {
    dataAvailability: number;
    syncQueueSize: number;
    lastSyncTime: Date;
  };
}
```

### Caching Implementation

#### Assignment-Specific Cache
- **Priority 1:** Current referee assignments (next 8 hours)
- **Priority 2:** Tournament context data (rules, venues, contacts)
- **Priority 3:** Historical assignment data for pattern recognition
- **Priority 4:** General tournament information

#### Cache Management Strategy
```typescript
interface CacheManagement {
  preloading: {
    assignments: 'schedule-based';
    tournaments: 'context-aware';
    results: 'on-demand';
  };
  eviction: {
    strategy: 'LRU-with-priority';
    maxStorage: '50MB';
    cleanupInterval: '6-hours';
  };
  synchronization: {
    backgroundSync: 'wifi-preferred';
    conflictResolution: 'server-wins';
    retryStrategy: 'exponential-backoff';
  };
}
```

### Loading State Optimization

#### Context-Aware Loading States
```typescript
interface LoadingStates {
  assignmentLoading: {
    message: "Loading your assignments...";
    progress: true;
    estimatedTime: number;
  };
  tournamentContext: {
    message: "Preparing tournament data...";
    progress: true;
    estimatedTime: number;
  };
  offlineSync: {
    message: "Syncing offline changes...";
    progress: true;
    estimatedTime: number;
  };
}
```
