# Risk Mitigation Across Epics

## Technical Risks
1. **FIVB API Changes**: Comprehensive error handling and API versioning
2. **Supabase Service Limits**: Usage monitoring and scaling preparation
3. **Mobile Performance**: Battery and memory optimization throughout
4. **Data Consistency**: Version tracking and conflict resolution

## Delivery Risks
1. **Epic Dependencies**: Clear handoff criteria between epics
2. **Testing Complexity**: Incremental testing approach for each epic
3. **Rollback Requirements**: Each epic must be independently rollbackable
4. **Performance Regression**: Continuous monitoring and benchmarking

This epic structure ensures systematic delivery of the multi-tier caching system while maintaining backward compatibility and managing complexity through clear phase separation.
