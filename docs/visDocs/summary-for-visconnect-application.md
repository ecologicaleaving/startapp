# Summary for VisConnect Application

Based on this documentation analysis, here are the key findings for the VisConnect MVP:

### ‚úÖ Available for Public Use
- **Tournament Metadata**: List of 346 tournaments (IDs only)
- **Player Metadata**: List of 113,588 players (IDs only)
- **Match Metadata**: List of 3,656 matches (IDs only)
- **Event Metadata**: List of 1,570 events (IDs only)
- **Service Information**: API version and status

### ‚ùå Requires Authentication

- **Match Results**: Scores, statistics, live data
- **Player Information**: Names, countries, photos, statistics
- **Rankings**: World rankings, tournament standings
- **Live Data**: Real-time match information

### üöÄ Recommended MVP Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Use public endpoints for app structure and counts
2. **Phase 2**: Create compelling UI/UX with mock data
3. **Phase 3**: Negotiate API access with FIVB for production data
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate authenticated endpoints for full functionality

The API is comprehensive and production-ready, but the freemium access model means detailed volleyball data requires official partnership with FIVB.
