# Rate Limiting and Best Practices

### Recommendations

1. **Cache Data**: Tournament lists and player data change infrequently
2. **Batch Requests**: Use multiple requests in single call when possible
3. **Use Compression**: Enable GZIP compression for large responses
4. **Respect Rate Limits**: Avoid excessive requests to prevent blocking
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff

### Response Compression

The API supports GZIP compression. Include appropriate headers:

```
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
```
