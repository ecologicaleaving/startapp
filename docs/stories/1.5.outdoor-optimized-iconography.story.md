# Story 1.5: Outdoor-Optimized Iconography

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** tournament referee using the app in various outdoor lighting conditions,  
**I want** high-visibility icons that remain clear and recognizable,  
**so that** I can quickly navigate and understand interface functions even in challenging visual conditions.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 (Status-Driven Color Coding System) completion notes:
- **Design Token Infrastructure**: Comprehensive design token system established in `theme/tokens.ts` with solid foundation for icon color extensions
- **Component Architecture**: Semantic component approach successfully implemented - follow same patterns for icon components
- **WCAG AAA Compliance**: 7:1 contrast ratios successfully maintained across all previous implementations - must apply same standard to icons
- **Performance Optimization**: StyleSheet.create() and React.memo patterns established as performance standards
- **Cross-component Integration**: Successful integration pattern with TournamentList/TournamentDetail established

### Technical Context & Stack
**React Native/Expo Application Setup**:
- React Native 0.79.5 with React 19.0.0 [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Expo SDK ~53.0.20 with expo-router for navigation [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- TypeScript configuration already in place [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Testing with Jest ~29.7.0 and @testing-library/react-native [Source: previous story testing]

**Key Dependencies Available**:
- @expo/vector-icons for iconography integration [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Expo Symbols for system icon integration [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- React Navigation v7 for navigation icons [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Existing theme system with comprehensive color palette [Source: theme/tokens.ts]

### Icon System Requirements
**Source: [docs/epics/epic-001-visual-design-system.md#user-story-5]**

**Icon Design Standards**:
- **High-Contrast Outlined Variants**: All icons must have outlined variants for maximum outdoor visibility
- **Touch Target Compliance**: Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive icons
- **Consistent Style**: Unified icon family with consistent stroke width and corner radius
- **Outdoor Optimization**: Icons must remain recognizable in direct sunlight conditions

**Performance Requirements**:
- **Icon Sprite Optimization**: Implement efficient icon loading and caching
- **Performance Budgets**: Minimize impact on mobile app performance
- **Progressive Loading**: Critical icons load first, secondary icons load as needed

### Existing Design Token System
**Source: [theme/tokens.ts from Story 1.4 implementation]**

**Available Color Integration**:
- Existing WCAG AAA compliant colors available for icon theming
- Status color system implemented in Story 1.4 can be leveraged for icon states
- Brand colors aligned with FIVB guidelines available for professional icon styling

**Typography Integration**: Existing semantic typography components from Story 1.3 should be used alongside icons for labels and descriptions

### Component Architecture Requirements
**Source: [Previous story patterns and existing codebase structure from component-integration-guide.md]**

**Existing Foundation to Extend**:
- Design tokens: `theme/tokens.ts` - **EXTEND with icon-specific tokens**
- Component patterns: Follow StatusBadge/StatusCard patterns established in Story 1.4
- Performance patterns: React.memo and StyleSheet.create() patterns established
- Testing patterns: `__tests__/` structure established - **FOLLOW existing testing patterns**

**New Icon-Specific Structure**:
- Icon components: `components/Icons/` - **CREATE icon component library**
- Icon assets: `assets/icons/` or integrated with @expo/vector-icons - **DETERMINE best approach**
- Icon utilities: `utils/icons.ts` - **CREATE icon helper functions**

### File Locations & Project Structure
**Source: [CLAUDE.md and previous story implementation patterns]**

**Files to Create**:
- Icon components: `components/Icons/Icon.tsx`, `IconLibrary.tsx` 
- Icon utilities: `utils/icons.ts` - **Icon loading and optimization functions**
- Icon tests: `__tests__/components/Icons/` - **Comprehensive icon component testing**
- Icon documentation: `docs/ICON-LIBRARY-GUIDE.md` - **Icon usage guidelines**

**Files to Modify**:
- Existing components: `components/TournamentList.tsx`, `components/TournamentDetail.tsx` - **INTEGRATE new icons**
- Design tokens: `theme/tokens.ts` - **ADD icon-specific color tokens if needed**

### Technical Constraints & Standards
**Source: [CLAUDE.md and React Native best practices]**

**React Native Icon System Approach**:
- Leverage @expo/vector-icons for scalable vector icon support
- StyleSheet.create() for icon styling performance optimization
- Component memoization for icon rendering performance
- Platform-consistent icon behavior (iOS/Android)

**Performance Considerations**:
- Efficient icon asset loading and caching
- Minimize icon bundle size impact
- Optimize for mobile memory constraints
- Use icon sprites for frequently used icons

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Maintain 7:1 contrast ratios established in previous stories
- Proper semantic labeling for screen readers
- Touch target compliance (44px minimum) for interactive icons
- Support for high contrast accessibility modes

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test Framework**: Jest ~29.7.0 with @testing-library/react-native ~13.2.2 [Source: Story 1.4 testing setup]

**Test File Locations**:
- Icon component tests: `__tests__/components/Icons/`
- Icon utility tests: `__tests__/utils/icons.test.ts`
- Visual regression tests: `__tests__/visual/icons.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/` (icon integration with existing components)

**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story**:
- Icon contrast ratio validation testing
- Icon touch target size validation testing
- Icon accessibility testing (screen reader compatibility)
- Icon performance testing (loading times, memory usage)
- Outdoor visibility testing (manual testing with actual sunlight conditions)

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- All icon utility functions: 100% coverage
- Icon components: 95% coverage  
- Icon integration: 85% coverage
- Visual regression tests for all icon variants

**Integration with Existing Testing**:
- **EXTEND** existing visual testing to validate icon appearance
- **ENHANCE** component testing to include icon integration validation
- **MAINTAIN** existing test coverage standard established in previous stories
