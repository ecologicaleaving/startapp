## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Source: Story 5.1 Implementation**

Story 5.1 established the referee interface foundation with tournament selection and state-based navigation. Key patterns established:
- TournamentStorageService for persistent data storage using AsyncStorage
- High-contrast design system optimized for outdoor viewing
- State-based navigation with bottom tabs appearing after tournament selection
- Integration with existing VisApiService for tournament data
- RefereeDashboardScreen as the main hub after tournament selection

### Architecture Context
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/information-architecture.md]**

#### Navigation Integration
The My Assignments feature integrates into the existing state-based navigation established in Story 5.1:
- **State 2 (Tournament Selected)**: Bottom tab bar with "My Assignments" as primary tab
- **Persistent tournament context**: Selected tournament from Story 5.1 provides context for assignment filtering
- **Progressive disclosure**: Assignment details accessible via tap interactions

#### Screen Structure
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/screen-layouts.md]**

**My Assignments Screen Layout**:
- **Current Assignment Card - Extra Large Display**: Prominent hero card showing most relevant assignment
- **Upcoming assignments list**: Chronologically ordered standard cards
- **Completed assignments**: Muted reference cards for historical context
- **High contrast design**: Optimized for outdoor tournament visibility

### Data Integration
**Source: [database-schema.md] and [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### Database Schema Integration
The matches table contains referee assignment information:
- `referee1_name` and `referee2_name` fields contain assigned referee names
- `no_referee1` and `no_referee2` contain referee IDs/numbers
- `referee1_federation_code` and `referee2_federation_code` for referee details
- Foreign key relationship to tournaments ensures data consistency

#### Data Filtering Strategy
```typescript
// Filter matches for current referee assignments
const refereeMatches = matches.filter(match => 
  match.referee1_name === currentReferee.name || 
  match.referee2_name === currentReferee.name
);
```

#### Match Status Categories for Assignment Display
- **Current/Active**: Matches with status 'Running' or scheduled within next 2 hours
- **Upcoming**: Future scheduled matches (status 'Scheduled')
- **Completed**: Historical matches (status 'Finished', 'Final')
- **Cancelled**: Cancelled or postponed matches

### API Integration  
**Source: [brownfield-architecture.yaml] and [api-specifications.md]**

#### Service Layer Integration
Builds on existing VisApiService patterns established in previous stories:
- Reuse GetBeachMatchList API endpoint for match data
- Integrate with caching layer from Stories 2.1 and 2.2 for performance
- Follow existing authentication and error handling patterns

#### Data Refresh Strategy
```typescript
// Automatic refresh intervals based on match proximity
const refreshInterval = getCurrentAssignmentStatus() === 'active' 
  ? 30000  // 30 seconds for active matches
  : 300000; // 5 minutes for upcoming matches
```

### UI/UX Implementation
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/component-library-design-system.md]**

#### Component Design Patterns
**Assignment Card Hierarchy**:
- **Current Assignment (Hero)**: Extra large card with prominent styling
- **Upcoming Assignment**: Standard size with clear information hierarchy
- **Completed Assignment**: Muted styling for reference context

#### Status-Based Visual Design
**Color Coding System**:
- **Active/Current** (Green): High contrast green for matches in progress or imminent
- **Upcoming** (Blue): Professional blue for future scheduled assignments  
- **Completed** (Gray): Muted gray for completed historical assignments
- **Cancelled** (Red): Alert red for cancelled or problematic assignments

#### Touch Optimization
**Source: [referee-frontend-spec/accessibility-requirements.md]**
- **Minimum touch targets**: 44px for all interactive elements
- **Large text sizes**: Minimum 16px font size for outdoor readability
- **High contrast ratios**: WCAG AAA compliance for sunlight conditions

### Component Architecture
**Source: Current codebase structure**

#### File Structure
```
screens/
  MyAssignmentsScreen.tsx          // Main assignments view screen
components/
  referee/
    CurrentAssignmentCard.tsx      // Hero current assignment display
    UpcomingAssignmentCard.tsx     // Standard upcoming assignment card
    CompletedAssignmentCard.tsx    // Muted completed assignment card
services/
  RefereeAssignmentsService.ts     // Assignment data filtering and management
types/
  RefereeAssignments.ts           // TypeScript interfaces for assignment data
```

#### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
interface RefereeAssignment {
  matchNo: string;
  tournamentNo: string;
  matchInTournament: string;
  teamAName: string;
  teamBName: string;
  localDate: Date;
  localTime: string;
  court: string;
  status: 'Scheduled' | 'Running' | 'Finished' | 'Cancelled';
  round: string;
  refereeRole: 'referee1' | 'referee2';

  - **How**: Added proper expo-router navigation with assignment data passing via route params

- **File**: `types/RefereeAssignments.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed redundant `isCurrentUser` boolean field from RefereeAssignment interface
  - **Why**: Since assignments are pre-filtered for current referee, this field was redundant and created unnecessary complexity
  - **How**: Cleaned up interface to focus on essential assignment data only

- **File**: `app/assignment-detail.tsx`
  - **Change**: Created missing route wrapper file for assignment detail screen
  - **Why**: File was listed in implementation but didn't exist, causing navigation failures
  - **How**: Added proper route export following established expo-router patterns

- **File**: `screens/MyAssignmentsScreen.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added proper accessibility labels for ScrollView component
