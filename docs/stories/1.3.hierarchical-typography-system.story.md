### Information Architecture Patterns
**Source: [docs/referee-frontend-spec/information-architecture.md]**

**State-Based Typography Hierarchy**:
- **Primary Focus**: Current assignments and active matches - Hero/H1 typography
- **Secondary Focus**: Upcoming assignments and schedule changes - H2 typography  
- **Tertiary Focus**: Completed matches and historical data - Body typography

**Navigation Typography Requirements**:
- **Tournament Selection**: Large, touch-friendly tournament names (H1)
- **Referee Dashboard**: Clear section headers with status-driven emphasis (H2)
- **Tab Navigation**: Consistent typography sizing for outdoor visibility

### Component Architecture Requirements
**Source: [docs/stories/1.1 and 1.2 completion notes]**

**Existing Foundation to Extend**:
- Design tokens: `theme/tokens.ts` - **EXTEND with enhanced typography hierarchy**
- Typography components: `components/Typography/` - **BUILD semantic component library**
- Theme Context: `theme/EnhancedThemeContext.tsx` - **INTEGRATE typography preferences**
- Brand system: `components/Brand/` - **APPLY typography consistency**

**New Typography-Specific Structure**:
- Typography components: `components/Typography/` - **CREATE semantic components (Title, Heading, etc.)**
- Typography utilities: `utils/typography.ts` - **CREATE scanning optimization utilities**
- Typography documentation: `docs/TYPOGRAPHY-GUIDE.md` - **DOCUMENT hierarchy patterns**

### File Locations & Project Structure
**Source: [CLAUDE.md and previous story implementation patterns]**

**Existing Structure to Extend**:
- Design tokens: `theme/tokens.ts` - **ENHANCE typography scale with semantic naming**
- Text components: `components/Foundation/Text.tsx` - **EXTEND with hierarchy variants**
- Theme system: `theme/` directory - **INTEGRATE typography preferences**
- Component library: `components/Foundation/` - **APPLY consistent typography**

**New Files to Create**:
- Typography components: `components/Typography/Title.tsx`, `Heading.tsx`, `BodyText.tsx`, `Caption.tsx`
- Typography utilities: `utils/typography.ts` - **Scanning optimization functions**
- Typography guide: `docs/TYPOGRAPHY-GUIDE.md` - **Usage patterns and examples**
- Typography tests: `__tests__/components/Typography/` - **Comprehensive testing**

### Design Token Integration Strategy
**CRITICAL**: This story must ENHANCE the existing typography system from Stories 1.1 and 1.2, NOT replace it.

**Enhancement Approach**:
- **Extend `theme/tokens.ts`**: Add semantic typography variants while preserving existing scale
- **Create semantic components**: Build Title, Heading, Subheading components using existing typography tokens
- **Maintain brand integration**: Ensure typography hierarchy works with FIVB brand styling from Story 1.2
- **Preserve accessibility**: Maintain 7:1 contrast ratios established in Story 1.1

### Technical Constraints & Standards
**Source: [docs/development-setup-guide.md and React Native best practices]**

**React Native Typography Approach**:
- StyleSheet.create() for typography performance optimization
- Platform-specific font handling (iOS vs Android)
- Responsive typography using dimensions and pixel density
- Theme provider pattern for consistent typography access

**Performance Considerations**:
- Efficient font loading and caching for large typography scales
- Typography component memoization for smooth scrolling
- Proper text measurement for dynamic layouts

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Maintain 7:1 contrast ratios from Story 1.1 for all typography combinations
- Support dynamic text sizing for accessibility preferences
- Proper semantic markup for screen readers

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test Framework**: Jest ~29.7.0 with @testing-library/react-native ~13.2.2

**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story**:
- Typography hierarchy rendering validation across all components
- Typography scaling responsiveness testing (device sizes and orientations)
- Information scanning pattern validation (reading order, emphasis patterns)
- Typography consistency testing across all screens and components
- Performance testing for typography-heavy screens

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- All typography utility functions: 100% coverage
- Typography components: 95% coverage
