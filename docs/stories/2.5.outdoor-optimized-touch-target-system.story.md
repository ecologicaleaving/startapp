## Status
Draft

## Story

   - **Navigation Elements:** Tab bars, menu items, and navigation controls
2. Touch target visual indicators for improved usability feedback
3. Component spacing optimized to prevent accidental touch interactions
4. Touch feedback system with appropriate haptic and visual responses
5. Component testing with outdoor condition simulation (wet, gloved interaction)
