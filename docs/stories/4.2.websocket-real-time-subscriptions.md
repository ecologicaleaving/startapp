## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1 implementation, the live score sync Edge Function is already updating the database with live scores every 30 seconds. Key learnings:
- **Performance Architecture**: 5-tier cache architecture with priority queuing (FIVB > CEV > BPT > LOCAL)
- **Database Enhancement**: Matches table includes live score fields (`points_a`, `points_b`, `set_scores`, `live_updated_at`)
- **Real-time Triggers**: Database triggers are in place for automatic timestamp updates
- **Tournament Activity Detection**: Smart filtering identifies truly live matches during tournament hours

### Supabase Real-Time Configuration
**WebSocket Subscription Setup** [Source: database-schema.md#real-time-configuration]:
```sql
-- Real-time already enabled for tournaments and matches tables
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE tournaments;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE matches;
```

**Connection Configuration** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#supabase_backend]:
- **Real-time subscriptions**: WebSocket subscriptions for active match score updates
- **Tournament status**: Real-time tournament status change notifications

### Technical Architecture Requirements
**Client-Side Real-Time Integration** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#client_cache_layer]:
- **CacheService Integration**: Real-time subscription management within existing cache architecture
- **Storage Tier Integration**: Real-time updates should integrate with Tier 1 (Memory) and Tier 2 (Local) cache
- **API Fallback**: Maintain fallback to Tier 4 (Direct API) when real-time fails

**Performance Optimization Requirements** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#performance_optimization]:
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient connection management for mobile constraints
- **Memory Management**: Proper subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Connection State Management**: Handle background/foreground app transitions

### Existing Service Integration Points
**CacheService Enhancement** [Source: Story 4.1 Dev Notes]:
```typescript
// Enhanced CacheService for Live Scores
class CacheService {
  // Real-time cache updates integration point
  static async updateLiveScores(matchScores: LiveScore[]): Promise<void> {
    // Update Tier 1 Memory cache immediately
    // Trigger UI updates through real-time subscriptions
  }
}
```

**Component Integration Requirements**:
- **TournamentList**: Real-time tournament status updates
- **TournamentDetail**: Live match score subscriptions  
- **Match Components**: Individual match score real-time updates

### WebSocket Connection Management
**Connection Lifecycle** [Source: brownfield-architecture.yaml#error_handling]:
- **Auto-reconnection**: Handle network interruptions with exponential backoff
- **Resource Management**: Clean subscription management to prevent battery drain
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure UI state consistency during connection changes

**Error Handling Patterns**:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to polling when WebSocket connections fail
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent excessive reconnection attempts
- **User Feedback**: Clear indication of connection status and fallback modes

### Database Integration Context
**Live Score Fields Available** [Source: Story 4.1 Database Enhancement]:
```sql
-- Enhanced matches table structure from Story 4.1
- points_a, points_b (current match points)
- set_scores JSONB (detailed set-by-set scores)
- live_updated_at TIMESTAMP (last live update)
- status VARCHAR (includes 'live', 'in_progress' states)
```

**Real-Time Query Patterns**:
```sql
-- Subscribe to live matches for specific tournament
SELECT * FROM matches 
WHERE tournament_no = $1 AND status IN ('live', 'in_progress')
ORDER BY local_date, local_time;

-- Subscribe to tournament status changes
SELECT * FROM tournaments 
WHERE status = 'Running' AND start_date <= NOW() AND end_date >= NOW();
```

### React Native Integration Considerations
**Supabase Client Configuration** [Source: services/supabase.ts from Story 1.1]:
- Existing Supabase client configured with real-time capabilities
- React Native specific optimizations already in place
- Environment variables and authentication configured

**Component Lifecycle Management**:
- Use React hooks for subscription management
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect dependencies
- Handle component unmounting with subscription cleanup

### Performance and Battery Optimization
**Mobile-Specific Optimizations**:
- **Subscription Throttling**: Limit update frequency to prevent excessive re-renders
- **Background State Handling**: Pause subscriptions when app is backgrounded
- **Selective Subscriptions**: Only subscribe to data for currently active screens
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections efficiently

**Resource Management**:
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper subscription cleanup and garbage collection
- **Battery Usage Monitoring**: Track real-time feature impact on battery life
- **Network Optimization**: Minimize WebSocket message frequency and size

## Testing

### Unit Testing Requirements
- **RealTimeSubscriptionService**: Test subscription lifecycle, reconnection logic, error handling
- **React Hooks**: Test subscription management hooks with proper cleanup
- **Connection State Management**: Test state transitions and error scenarios

### Integration Testing Requirements
- **UI Real-Time Updates**: End-to-end testing of live score updates in components
- **Subscription Cleanup**: Verify no memory leaks or orphaned subscriptions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Test graceful degradation to polling and cache fallback
- **Performance Testing**: Battery usage and resource consumption validation

### Testing Tools and Frameworks
- **Jest**: Unit testing for service classes and utility functions
- **React Native Testing Library**: Component testing with real-time updates
- **Supabase Test Utilities**: WebSocket subscription testing tools
- **Performance Profiling**: React Native performance monitoring

### Test Scenarios
- **Happy Path**: Normal WebSocket subscription with live updates
- **Network Interruption**: Connection loss and automatic reconnection
- **Background/Foreground**: App state transitions and subscription management
- **High Frequency Updates**: Stress testing with rapid score changes
- **Component Cleanup**: Subscription cleanup on component unmount
- **Fallback Testing**: WebSocket failure with degradation to polling
