# Story 3.3: Referee Information Hierarchy Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a tournament referee,**  
**I need all screens to prioritize referee-relevant information with clear visual hierarchy,**  
**so that I can quickly scan and find the information most important to my current responsibilities.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Information hierarchy redesigned across all screens with referee-first prioritization:
   - **Primary Information:** Referee assignments, current responsibilities, time-critical data
   - **Secondary Information:** Tournament context, match details, team information
   - **Tertiary Information:** General tournament information, statistics, administrative details
2. Visual hierarchy implemented with consistent design patterns:
   - **Hero Content:** Most important referee information prominently displayed
   - **Information Grouping:** Related information grouped with clear visual separation
   - **Scanning Optimization:** Information layout optimized for quick referee scanning patterns
3. Screen consistency maintained while optimizing for referee workflow needs
4. Information density balanced for mobile device readability and comprehensive data access
5. Context-sensitive information display based on referee's current assignment status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.2 (Dedicated My Assignments Screen):
- Established assignment-first hierarchy patterns in MyAssignmentsScreen with CurrentAssignmentCard as hero content
- Created comprehensive assignment status management system with AssignmentStatusManager modal
- Implemented enhanced assignment interaction with EnhancedAssignmentCard variants supporting multiple display modes
- Built dual view modes (list/timeline) optimizing for different scanning patterns and referee workflow needs
- Integrated offline capability with AsyncStorage caching ensuring information availability in all referee contexts

### Information Architecture & User Experience Design
**Source:** `docs/referee-frontend-spec/information-architecture.md`, `docs/referee-frontend-spec/ux-goals-principles.md`
- Tournament referee persona requires instant recognition of current assignment within 3 seconds of opening app
- Information hierarchy must support one-handed operation with single thumb interaction for outdoor conditions
- Design principle "Essential Information Only" - show only what referees need for current/next matches
- Navigation structure supports state-based information display with tournament-selected context enabling referee features
- Information architecture follows referee-first prioritization with assignment data as primary focal point

### Visual Hierarchy & Design System Specifications
**Source:** `docs/referee-frontend-spec/component-library-design-system.md`, `docs/referee-frontend-spec/branding-style-guide.md`
- Assignment Card component system with status-based visual hierarchy: Current Assignment (Hero/Extra Large), Upcoming Assignment (Standard), Completed Assignment (Muted)
- Status-driven design approach where every component communicates current state with color coding: Active (Green), Upcoming (Blue), Completed (Gray), Cancelled (Red)
- Typography hierarchy with Hero (40px Bold) for court numbers, H1 (32px Bold) for screen titles, H2 (24px Semibold) for sections, Body Large (18px Regular) for primary content
- Touch-optimized design with 44px minimum touch targets, 56px preferred for outdoor conditions
- Spacing system based on 8px grid with 16px minimum content margins from screen edges

### Screen Layout Requirements & Information Density
**Source:** `docs/referee-frontend-spec/screen-layouts.md`, `docs/referee-frontend-spec/ux-goals-principles.md`
- Referee Dashboard requires Current Assignment Card as extra large display with court number, team names, match time, and status prominently visible
- Information density must balance mobile device readability with comprehensive data access requirements
- Hero content positioning for most important referee information with clear visual separation from secondary content
- Context-sensitive information display based on referee assignment status (upcoming, active, completed states)
- Scanning optimization requirements for quick referee information location under outdoor conditions

### Component Architecture & Technical Implementation
**Source:** `CLAUDE.md`, Story 3.1 and 3.2 implementation patterns
- React Native 0.79.5 with React 19 architecture using Expo Router for file-based navigation
- Component structure follows themed wrapper patterns extending base React Native components with platform-specific variants
- Path aliases `@/*` configured for root directory imports enabling clean component organization
- Status indicator integration from Story 2.4 Professional Status Indicator System available for hierarchy implementation
- Enhanced assignment components from Story 3.2 provide foundation patterns for information hierarchy extension

### File Locations & Project Structure
**Source:** Story 3.1 and 3.2 implementation, project structure analysis
- **Main Screens:** `screens/RefereeDashboardScreen.tsx`, `screens/MyAssignmentsScreen.tsx`, `screens/TournamentInfoScreen.tsx` - Primary screens requiring hierarchy redesign

- **Navigation Components:** `components/navigation/` - Header and navigation components requiring hierarchy integration
- **Design Tokens:** `theme/tokens.ts` - Typography, spacing, and color systems for hierarchy implementation

### Performance & Outdoor Optimization Requirements
**Source:** `docs/referee-frontend-spec/performance-considerations.md`, `docs/referee-frontend-spec/ux-goals-principles.md`
- Performance goals require under 2 seconds page load and under 100ms interaction response for quick information access
- Sunlight legibility requirement demands maximum contrast and large fonts taking priority over aesthetics
- Visibility First design principle requires high contrast ratios and outdoor-optimized visual hierarchy
- Speed Priority with core information loading under 2 seconds supporting referee workflow efficiency
- Touch optimization for wet or sandy hands requires large, well-separated interactive elements

### Testing Requirements
