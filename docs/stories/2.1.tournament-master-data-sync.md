## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source: [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### Background Synchronization Strategy
The tournament master data sync is the foundation of Epic 2's background synchronization system. It establishes the pattern for all subsequent sync operations.

**Sync Frequency Rationale**:
- **Daily execution** at 00:00 UTC ensures fresh tournament data for global users
- Tournament master data (names, dates, locations) changes infrequently
- Daily sync balances data freshness with API usage efficiency

**Edge Function Architecture**:
- **Runtime**: Deno with TypeScript support
- **Authentication**: Service role access to Supabase
- **Secrets**: FIVB API credentials stored in Supabase vault
- **Scheduling**: Cron-based triggers via `pg_cron` extension

#### Data Flow Integration
**Source: [database-schema.md]**

**Tournament Table Mapping**:
- `no` ← Tournament.No (primary identifier from FIVB API)
- `code` ← Tournament.Code (tournament code like "MWBVT2025")
- `name` ← Tournament.Name (display name)
- `start_date` ← Tournament.StartDate (parsed from XML date format)
- `end_date` ← Tournament.EndDate (parsed from XML date format)
- `status` ← Tournament.Status (Running, Finished, etc.)
- `location` ← Tournament.Location (venue/city information)

**Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
- Primary key: `no` field from FIVB API
- UPSERT operation using `ON CONFLICT (no) DO UPDATE`
- Preserve `created_at`, update `updated_at` and `last_synced`
- Version increment for change tracking

### FIVB API Integration
**Source: [visDocs/authentication.md] and [visDocs/api-endpoints.md]**

#### Authentication Implementation
**Primary Method**: JWT Authentication
- Retrieve stored credentials from Supabase vault
- Generate JWT token for API requests
- Include token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

**Fallback Method**: Request-level Authentication
```xml
<Requests Username="username" Password="password">
  <Request Type="GetBeachTournamentList" />
</Requests>
```

#### API Endpoint Details
**Endpoint**: `GetBeachTournamentList`
- **URL**: `https://www.fivb.org/Vis2009/XmlRequest.asmx`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `application/xml`
- **Response**: XML format with tournament list

**Expected Response Structure**:
```xml
<Tournaments>
  <Tournament>
    <No>123456</No>
    <Code>MWBVT2025</Code>
    <Name>Beach Volleyball World Tour 2025</Name>
    <StartDate>2025-06-15</StartDate>
    <EndDate>2025-06-22</EndDate>
    <Status>Running</Status>
    <Location>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</Location>
  </Tournament>
</Tournaments>
```

### Sync Status Tracking Implementation
**Source: [database-schema.md]**

#### sync_status Table Updates
```sql
-- Update sync execution record
UPDATE sync_status 
SET 
  last_sync = NOW(),
  next_sync = NOW() + sync_frequency,
  success_count = success_count + 1,
  last_error = NULL,
  last_error_time = NULL,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE entity_type = 'tournaments';
```

#### Error Tracking
```sql
-- Record sync failure
UPDATE sync_status 
SET 
  error_count = error_count + 1,
  last_error = 'API authentication failed: Invalid JWT token',
  last_error_time = NOW(),
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE entity_type = 'tournaments';
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
**Source: [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### Batch Processing Implementation
- **Chunk Size**: Process tournaments in batches of 50 records
- **Database Connections**: Single connection with transaction management
- **Memory Management**: Stream XML parsing to avoid loading large responses

#### Database Optimization
- **Prepared Statements**: Use parameterized queries for UPSERT operations
- **Index Usage**: Leverage existing indexes on `no`, `code`, `start_date`
- **Connection Pool**: Utilize Supabase connection pooling for efficiency

### Error Handling and Resilience
**Source: [brownfield-architecture.yaml]**

#### Retry Strategy
```typescript
// Exponential backoff configuration
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000, // 1 second
  maxDelay: 30000, // 30 seconds
  backoffMultiplier: 2
};
```

#### Error Classification
- **Transient Errors**: Network timeouts, temporary API failures → Retry
- **Authentication Errors**: Invalid credentials → Fail fast with detailed logging
- **Data Format Errors**: Invalid XML response → Skip record, continue processing
- **Database Errors**: Connection issues → Retry with exponential backoff

### Integration with Existing System
**Source: [existing codebase analysis]**

#### Backward Compatibility Preservation
The sync function operates independently of existing client code:
- No changes required to existing `TournamentList.tsx` component
- No modifications to `VisApiService.ts` interface
- Cache integration happens transparently at service layer

#### Cache Enhancement Foundation
This sync establishes the data foundation for:
- **Story 2.2**: Match schedule synchronization
- **Story 2.3**: Sync monitoring and health tracking
- **Epic 3**: Service layer integration with caching

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing Framework
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/tournament-master-sync/test/`
- **Framework**: Deno testing with mocking capabilities
- **Coverage**: Authentication, API parsing, database operations, error handling

#### Integration Testing Scenarios
- **Happy Path**: Successful tournament sync with mixed insert/update operations
- **Authentication Failure**: JWT token expired, fallback to request-level auth
- **API Errors**: Malformed XML, network timeouts, rate limiting
- **Database Issues**: Connection failures, constraint violations
- **Partial Failures**: Some tournaments succeed, others fail gracefully

#### Test Data Requirements
- Mock FIVB API responses with various tournament states
- Test database with existing tournament data for conflict resolution
- Error simulation for all failure scenarios

### Deployment Considerations

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Supabase vault secrets
FIVB_API_USERNAME=your_username
FIVB_API_PASSWORD=your_password
FIVB_API_JWT_SECRET=jwt_signing_key

# Database connection (automatically provided by Supabase)
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]
```

#### Edge Function Deployment
```bash
# Deploy Edge Function
supabase functions deploy tournament-master-sync

# Set up cron trigger
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'tournament-sync-daily',
  '0 0 * * *',  -- Daily at 00:00 UTC
  'SELECT http_request(''POST'', ''https://[project].supabase.co/functions/v1/tournament-master-sync'')'
);
```

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Success Metrics
- **Sync Success Rate**: Target 99%+ successful executions
- **Processing Time**: Complete sync within 5 minutes
- **Data Freshness**: Tournament data updated within 24 hours
- **Error Recovery**: Failed syncs recovered within 1 retry attempt

#### Alerting Criteria
- **Consecutive Failures**: 2+ failed sync attempts
- **Processing Time**: Sync duration exceeds 10 minutes
- **Data Staleness**: No successful sync for 48+ hours
- **API Rate Limits**: Approaching FIVB API usage limits

### Future Extensibility

This tournament sync implementation provides the foundation for:
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Sync specific tournament types (FIVB, CEV, BPT)
- **Regional Optimization**: Geo-based sync scheduling
- **Advanced Caching**: Tournament-specific cache invalidation strategies
- **Analytics Integration**: Tournament participation and engagement metrics
