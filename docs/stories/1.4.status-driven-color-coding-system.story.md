### Status Color System Requirements
**Source: [docs/epics/epic-001-visual-design-system.md#user-story-4]**

**Status Color Mappings**:
- **Current/Active**: High-visibility alert orange (#FF6B35) - FIVB brand accent color
- **Upcoming**: Professional blue (#4A90A4) - FIVB secondary blue
- **Completed**: Success green with appropriate contrast - must meet 7:1 ratio
- **Cancelled/Changed**: Clear warning indicators - high contrast warning colors
- **Emergency/Urgent**: Maximum visibility treatment with enhanced contrast

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- **WCAG AAA Compliance**: All status colors must achieve 7:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Color-blind Support**: Alternative indicators (icons, patterns) required alongside color
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for interactive status elements
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth transitions optimized for mobile devices

### Existing Design Token System
**Source: [theme/tokens.ts]**

**Available Color Palette**:
```typescript
export const colors = {
  primary: '#1B365D',      // 12.12:1 contrast ✅
  secondary: '#2B5F75',    // 8.40:1 contrast ✅
  accent: '#B8391A',       // 4.75:1 contrast ✅
  success: '#1E5A3A',      // 8.14:1 contrast ✅
  warning: '#B8530A',      // 7.90:1 contrast ✅
  error: '#8B1538',        // 9.28:1 contrast ✅
  textPrimary: '#2C3E50',  // 10.98:1 contrast ✅
  textSecondary: '#445566', // 7.67:1 contrast ✅
  background: '#FFFFFF',
};

export const brandColors = {
  fivbPrimary: '#1B365D',
  fivbSecondary: '#4A90A4',  // For "Upcoming" status
  fivbAccent: '#FF6B35',     // For "Current/Active" status
  fivbSuccess: '#2E8B57',
  fivbWarning: '#FF8C00',
  fivbError: '#C41E3A',
};
```

**Typography Integration**: Existing semantic typography components (H1Text, H2Text, BodyText, etc.) from Story 1.3 should be used with status color system

### Component Architecture Requirements
**Source: [Previous story patterns and existing codebase structure]**

**Existing Foundation to Extend**:
- Design tokens: `theme/tokens.ts` - **EXTEND with status color mappings**
- Typography components: `components/Typography/` - **INTEGRATE status colors**
- Utility functions: `utils/colors.ts` and `utils/contrast.ts` - **EXTEND with status utilities**
- Testing patterns: `__tests__/` structure established - **FOLLOW existing testing patterns**

**New Status-Specific Structure**:
- Status components: `components/Status/` - **CREATE status indicator components**
- Status utilities: `utils/statusColors.ts` - **CREATE status color utilities**
- Animation utilities: `utils/statusAnimations.ts` - **CREATE status animation helpers**

### File Locations & Project Structure
**Source: [CLAUDE.md and previous story implementation patterns]**

**Files to Create**:
- Status components: `components/Status/StatusBadge.tsx`, `StatusCard.tsx`, `StatusIcon.tsx`, `StatusBar.tsx`
- Status utilities: `utils/statusColors.ts` - **Status color selection functions**
- Animation utilities: `utils/statusAnimations.ts` - **Status change animation helpers**
- Status tests: `__tests__/components/Status/` - **Comprehensive status component testing**

**Files to Modify**:
- Design tokens: `theme/tokens.ts` - **ADD status color mappings**
- Existing components: `components/TournamentList.tsx`, `components/TournamentDetail.tsx` - **INTEGRATE status indicators**
- Color utilities: `utils/colors.ts` - **ADD status color helper functions**

### Design Token Integration Strategy
**CRITICAL**: This story must EXTEND the existing design token system from Stories 1.1-1.3, maintaining compatibility.

**Enhancement Approach**:
- **Extend `theme/tokens.ts`**: Add status-specific color tokens using existing brand colors where appropriate
- **Maintain accessibility**: Ensure all status colors meet established 7:1 contrast ratios
- **Preserve existing patterns**: Follow established component architecture from Story 1.3
- **Color-blind support**: Add semantic alternatives alongside color coding

### Technical Constraints & Standards
**Source: [Previous story patterns and React Native best practices]**

**React Native Status System Approach**:
- StyleSheet.create() for status color performance optimization (following Story 1.3 patterns)
- Component memoization for status change performance
- Animation optimization using React Native Animated API
- Platform-consistent status indicator behavior

**Performance Considerations**:
- Efficient status color calculation and caching
- Smooth status change animations without blocking UI
- Memory-efficient status state management
- Minimal re-renders during status updates

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Maintain 7:1 contrast ratios established in previous stories
- Support for color-blind users with alternative indicators
- Proper semantic markup for screen readers
- Touch target compliance (44px minimum) for interactive status elements
