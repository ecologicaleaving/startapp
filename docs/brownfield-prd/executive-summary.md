# Executive Summary

## Problem Statement
The existing React Native tournament application directly queries the FIVB VIS API for every data request, leading to:
- Slow initial loading times (average 3-5 seconds for tournament lists)
- High API usage costs and rate limiting risks
- No offline capability during network interruptions
- Inability to provide real-time match score updates
- Poor user experience during peak tournament periods

## Solution Overview
Implement a sophisticated multi-tier caching system that integrates PostgreSQL/Supabase as a caching layer between the React Native app and FIVB VIS API. This brownfield enhancement will:
- **Reduce API calls by 70%** through intelligent caching strategies
- **Improve load times by 50%** via local data storage
- **Enable real-time features** with WebSocket subscriptions
- **Provide offline capability** for basic tournament browsing
- **Maintain 100% backward compatibility** with existing components

## Business Impact
- **Performance**: 50% faster tournament data loading
- **Cost**: 70% reduction in direct API calls
- **User Experience**: Real-time match scores and offline browsing
- **Reliability**: Reduced dependency on external API availability
- **Future-Ready**: Foundation for advanced analytics and features
