## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Static Content Visibility (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Verify all static text and color elements are clearly visible

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Hold device at normal viewing distance (18-24 inches)
2. Hold device at arm's length (30+ inches) 
3. Test with device tilted at various angles
4. Test with device in portrait and landscape orientations

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Pass**: Content clearly readable without squinting or strain
- **Warning**: Content readable but requires focused attention
- **Fail**: Content difficult to read or requires moving closer/adjusting position

### Phase 2: Interactive Elements Testing (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Validate button and interactive element visibility and usability

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Identify all buttons without prior knowledge of layout
2. Distinguish between different button states (enabled/disabled)
3. Recognize different button priorities (primary/secondary/accent)
4. Tap accuracy test for all button sizes

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Pass**: All interactive elements immediately identifiable and usable
- **Warning**: Some elements require closer inspection
- **Fail**: Interactive elements difficult to identify or use accurately

### Phase 3: Status Recognition Testing (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Verify status-driven color coding is instantly recognizable

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Quick identification of active vs. inactive states
2. Recognition of warning/error conditions
3. Distinction between different status types
4. Color recognition with peripheral vision

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Pass**: All status states immediately recognizable
- **Warning**: Status recognition requires deliberate focus
- **Fail**: Status states difficult to distinguish or confusing

### Phase 4: Rapid Information Scanning (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Test real-world usage patterns for tournament referees

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Quick court number identification
2. Rapid assignment detail scanning
3. Time-critical information processing
4. Information hierarchy clarity

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Pass**: Critical information accessible within 1-2 seconds
- **Warning**: Information requires 3-5 seconds to locate
- **Fail**: Information difficult to locate quickly

## High-Contrast Mode Implementation

### Automatic Adjustments
The application includes a high-contrast mode that can be enabled for extreme lighting conditions:

- **Secondary text color** switches to primary text color
- **Secondary brand color** switches to primary brand color
- **Enhanced border weights** for all interactive elements
- **Increased shadow opacity** for better depth perception

### Manual Override Controls
Users can manually adjust contrast settings:
- **Contrast boost toggle** - Increases all contrast ratios by 15%
- **Bold text mode** - Forces all text to semi-bold weight
- **Enhanced borders** - Increases border widths by 1px

## Validation Results Summary

### Expected Outcomes
Based on WCAG AAA compliance (7:1 minimum contrast ratios), the following results are expected:

- **95%+ Pass Rate** for typography visibility
- **90%+ Pass Rate** for color recognition  
- **95%+ Pass Rate** for button identification
- **85%+ Pass Rate** for rapid information scanning

### Success Criteria
- No critical failures in core functionality
- Average visibility rating of 4.0/5.0 or higher
- 90% of testers can complete primary tasks without assistance
- No accessibility barriers for users with vision corrections
