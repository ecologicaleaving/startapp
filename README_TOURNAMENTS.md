# Tournament List Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a simple page that displays tournaments from the FIVB VIS API in a list format.

## Files Created

### `/types/tournament.ts`
- TypeScript interfaces for Tournament data
- Defines the structure for API responses

### `/services/visApi.ts`
- API service class for communicating with FIVB VIS API
- Uses the public `GetTournamentList` endpoint
- Includes basic XML parsing for tournament numbers

### `/components/TournamentList.tsx`
- React Native component that displays the tournament list
- Includes loading states, error handling, and proper styling
- Uses FlatList for efficient rendering of tournament data

### `/app/index.tsx`
- Updated main screen to use the TournamentList component

## API Endpoint Used
- **Public Endpoint**: `GetTournamentList`
- **URL**: `https://www.fivb.org/Vis2009/XmlRequest.asmx`
- **Authentication**: Not required (public metadata only)
- **Returns**: Tournament numbers and basic metadata

## Features
- ✅ Loading indicator while fetching data
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with card-based list items
- ✅ Shows tournament numbers and names
- ✅ Responsive design

## Usage
Run the app with:
```bash
npm start
# or
npx expo start
```

## Notes
- The public API only provides tournament numbers, not detailed information
- Tournament names are currently fallback values since the public endpoint has limited data
- For full tournament details, authentication with FIVB VIS API would be required
- The implementation follows React Native and Expo best practices
